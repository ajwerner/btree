// An overlap scan is a scan over all latches that overlap with the provided
// latch in order of the overlapping latches' start keys. The goal of the scan
// is to minimize the number of key comparisons performed in total. The
// algorithm operates based on the following two invariants maintained by
// augmented interval abstract:
// 1. all latches are sorted in the abstract based on their start key.
// 2. all abstract nodes maintain the upper bound end key of all latches
//    in their suabstract.
//
// The scan algorithm starts in "unconstrained minimum" and "unconstrained
// maximum" states. To enter a "constrained minimum" state, the scan must reach
// latches in the tree with start keys above the search range's start key.
// Because latches in the tree are sorted by start key, once the scan enters the
// "constrained minimum" state it will remain there. To enter a "constrained
// maximum" state, the scan must determine the first child abstract node in a given
// suabstract that can have latches with start keys above the search range's end
// key. The scan then remains in the "constrained maximum" state until it
// traverse into this child node, at which point it moves to the "unconstrained
// maximum" state again.
//
// The scan algorithm works like a standard abstract forward scan with the
// following augmentations:
// 1. before tranversing the tree, the scan performs a binary search on the
//    root node's items to determine a "soft" lower-bound constraint position
//    and a "hard" upper-bound constraint position in the root's children.
// 2. when tranversing into a child node in the lower or upper bound constraint
//    position, the constraint is refined by searching the child's items.
// 3. the initial traversal down the tree follows the left-most children
//    whose upper bound end keys are equal to or greater than the start key
//    of the search range. The children followed will be equal to or less
//    than the soft lower bound constraint.
// 4. once the initial tranversal completes and the scan is in the left-most
//    abstract node whose upper bound overlaps the search range, key comparisons
//    must be performed with each latch in the tree. This is necessary because
//    any of these latches may have end keys that cause them to overlap with the
//    search range.
// 5. once the scan reaches the lower bound constraint position (the first latch
//    with a start key equal to or greater than the search range's start key),
//    it can begin scaning without performing key comparisons. This is allowed
//    because all latches from this point forward will have end keys that are
//    greater than the search range's start key.
// 6. once the scan reaches the upper bound constraint position, it terminates.
//    It does so because the latch at this position is the first latch with a
//    start key larger than the search range's end key.
